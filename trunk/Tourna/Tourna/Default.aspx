                and no one is really interested of what is going on. When we decided to work with
                Stornger org last summer we understood that when you arrange such a competition
                during the lunch hours and people are registered to that, then there is more excitement,
                people start talking with each other, not only with the people that they know and
                like. We suddenly saw tat the people are more involve, people are not shy to talk
                in companies meeting, something that wasn’t before. The value of having our employees
                talking with us and telling us what they think is so valuable for us.”

                that joined the event was higher by 80% from the previous times, this was amazing.
                “ Says Debera shean” property manager. “ We had never had such a thing” Our brad
                and image among our tenant increased dramatically, new tenants that came heard about
                our building events and were very impressed and it helped us to increase our sales

                a competition during the week can fit. However the guys in Stronger org came with
                an idea to boost my holiday event and to have a Wii competition. I never played
                with a Wii but my kids do. I wasn’t sure that the Wii can fit to my employees however
                on the day of the events after we had so many registration to the competition we
                had a great fun. People instead of just easting and coming again to a company event,
                really enjoyed they were excited and appreciated the innovative idea that we brought
                for lunch.” Says Maayan Margolin accountant “Everyone played”
