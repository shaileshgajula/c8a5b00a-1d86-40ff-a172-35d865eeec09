                “In our company we have a Wii in the dining room. 
                When we decided to work with Stronger org last summer we realized the potential of 
                arranging  competitions during the lunch hours.
                Once employees have registered to take part, there is a build-up of excitement 
                that pushes people to start talking with each other, outside their normal range of associates. 
                We suddenly saw that employees were more involved, not only in the dining room 
                but also in work meetings – a new development for usThe value of having our employees 
                participating and communicating with us is invaluable.”

                We do that every 6 months, this event is important for us to meet the tenants. 
                In the last event in which we brought StrongerOorg the number of tenants that 
                joined the event was 80% higher than previous events, this was amazing. 
                “Says Debra shean” property manager. 
                “We had never had such a thing” Our brand and image among our tenants increased dramatically, 
                new tenants that came heard about our building events and were very impressed and it helped us to increase our sales by 10%.” 
                “I will certainly repeat these tournaments every year with different games”

                would be possible. 
                However the guys in Stronger org came with an idea to boost my holiday event and to have a Wii competition. 
                I never played with a Wii but my kids do. I wasn’t sure that the Wii would suit my employees but on event day we had hundreds? Dozens? 
                of registrations to the competition we had a blast!  
                People instead actively participated instead of just eating and leaving.  
                They really enjoyed themselves and appreciated the innovative idea that we brought for lunch.”
